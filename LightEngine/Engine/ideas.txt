Step 1: Project Setup & Core Engine Architecture
At the start, focus on setting up the basic structure of the project, defining the primary game loop, and handling window creation.

Tasks:
Set up your project structure (source files, assets, build system, etc.).
Create a simple game loop: Initialization, update, render, and clean-up.
Define core engine classes: Engine, Game, Window, Time, and Input.
Initialize the window and set up basic event handling (input and window resizing).
Deliverables:
A basic project where a window is created, and the engine enters a main loop that updates and renders frames.


Step 2: Basic Rendering Pipeline
Once the project is structured and you have a basic game loop, the next step is to implement the rendering system.

Tasks:
Set up a renderer class to abstract drawing operations.
Implement basic 2D rendering: drawing shapes, images, and text.
Implement a basic sprite system to load and draw textures from files.
Support frame buffer clearing and basic drawing operations (e.g., drawImage(), drawRect()).
Deliverables:

Step 3: Scene Management
The scene management system will allow you to organize your game into separate "scenes," such as menus, levels, and game over screens.

Tasks:
Create a Scene class to hold game objects, layers, and other scene-specific data.
Implement a SceneManager to manage switching between scenes.
Implement scene transitions (e.g., fade in/out, or just instant transitions).
Introduce a GameObject system that holds entities like characters, enemies, and other interactive objects.
Deliverables:
A scene management system that allows you to load, update, and render different game scenes.
A GameObject class to represent entities in the scene.


Step 4: Layering and Z-Ordering
Games typically require multiple layers of rendering (background, characters, UI, etc.). Handling layering will help control how objects are drawn in the correct order.

Tasks:
Implement a layer system to manage different object types (e.g., background, entities, UI).
Introduce Z-ordering: Ensure objects are drawn in the correct order relative to their layer.
Modify the scene and renderer to support layering (draw the background first, then characters, then UI).
Deliverables:
A system that renders objects in multiple layers, ensuring correct depth sorting.


Step 5: Input System
Input handling is crucial for any interactive game. You need to process input from the user and propagate it to the appropriate objects.

Tasks:
Implement an input system to handle keyboard and mouse input.
Support for basic input actions (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks, and movement).
Integrate input handling into the main game loop.
Optionally, support for custom input bindings (e.g., defining "jump" to a specific key).
Deliverables:

Step 6: Sprite System & Animation
Your game will need an efficient system for displaying and animating characters, objects, and other elements.

Tasks:
Create a Sprite class to represent a 2D image, including position, rotation, and scaling.
Implement an Animation system to manage sprite sheets and frame-based animation.
Allow switching between different animation states (e.g., idle, walk, jump).
Implement basic sprite batching for efficient rendering (draw multiple sprites in one call).
Deliverables:
A sprite system capable of rendering individual images and handling basic sprite animations.


Step 7: Tilemap System
If your game uses grid-based worlds (like platformers or RPGs), you'll need a tilemap system to handle large game worlds efficiently.

Tasks:
Define a Tile class to represent individual tiles in a tilemap.
Create a Tilemap class to manage and render a grid of tiles.
Implement the ability to layer tilemaps (e.g., background, objects, etc.).

Deliverables:
A tilemap system that renders large levels using a grid of tiles.


Step 8: Asset Management & Serialization
Efficient management and loading of assets (textures, sounds, fonts) is essential for any game. Serialization will help you save and load game data (e.g., saving/loading game states, scene data).

Tasks:
Implement an AssetManager class to load, store, and manage textures, sounds, and other assets.
Support for loading and caching assets efficiently to avoid reloading them every frame.
Implement a basic serialization system (e.g., saving/loading level data, player progress).
Use file formats like JSON, XML, or binary for storing game data.
Deliverables:
A working asset management system that efficiently loads and caches assets.
A basic serialization system to save and load game state.


Step 9: UI System
Building a UI system is essential for menus, HUDs, and other in-game interfaces. This system allows you to create interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and text fields.

Tasks:
Implement a basic UI framework with elements like buttons, labels, and sliders.
Support for layout management (e.g., absolute positioning, anchors, or grids).
Handle mouse and keyboard events for UI interactions (e.g., clicking buttons).
Render the UI on top of the game scene, ensuring correct layering.
Deliverables:
A UI system that allows you to create and interact with menus and HUDs.


Step 10: Sound and Music System
Adding sound effects and music is key to making your game more immersive. This step involves setting up an audio system for playback.

Tasks:
Implement an audio manager to load and play sound effects and background music.
Support for different sound formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).
Implement a simple volume control and sound looping.
Optional: Add spatial audio (3D positioning of sound sources) if your game requires it.
Deliverables:
A sound system capable of playing background music and sound effects.


Step 11: Physics and Collision Detection
If your game requires object interaction (e.g., platformers, top-down shooters), you'll need a basic physics and collision system.

Tasks:
Implement basic 2D collision detection (e.g., AABB, circle collisions).
Optionally, implement physics for movement (e.g., gravity, velocity).
Integrate collision detection into the GameObject system (e.g., detect collisions between sprites and tiles).
Handle collision responses (e.g., bounce, stop, or push objects).
Deliverables:
A working collision system with basic physics handling.


Step 12: Game Editor (Optional)
Building a game editor allows you to design levels and tweak game settings without writing code. This step is optional but highly recommended for ease of use.

Tasks:
Create a GUI for managing scenes, assets, and game objects (e.g., drag-and-drop interface).
Integrate your editor with the engine so you can manipulate game objects and tilemaps.
Implement a scene editor that allows you to place and move objects visually.
Deliverables:
A basic game editor that allows you to visually design levels, place objects, and edit game scenes.


Step 13: Optimization and Refinement
Once the core features are in place, itâ€™s time to optimize performance and refine the engine.

Tasks:
Optimize rendering by batching draw calls, reducing state changes, and improving the asset loading system.
Profile performance and identify bottlenecks (e.g., in the physics system, input handling, or rendering).
Improve memory management and garbage collection (e.g., object pooling).
Add features like frame-rate independent movement and resolution scaling.
Deliverables:
A polished engine that runs smoothly and is efficient.


Step 14: Packaging and Distribution
Finally, you'll want to package your game engine for use by others or for deployment.

Tasks:
Create a build system (e.g., CMake) for compiling the engine and games.
Package the engine with necessary libraries (e.g., asset management, external libraries).
Ensure cross-platform support (if needed) and build for various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Write documentation on how to use the engine and its features.
Deliverables:
A final build of the engine, ready for distribution or further development.
